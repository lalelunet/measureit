Welcome to the measureit Project

Measureit allows you to have your own server to store your voltage and temperature data. It has a  easy to use web interface that is completely written in javascript and jquery to see your power consumption.

Currently it works with the hardware from Current Cost (currentcost.com) with the Classic, Envi and the EnviR

You are able to see the detailed consumption in real time or see your consumption from the last week or from a user defined time range and has a overview of the energy consumption and cost per sensor / sensor position / year / month /day usage. There are also different graphs to display a weekly or yearly overview in a comparison or you can see the data usage per weekday or per hour or.....

[https://code.google.com/p/measureit/wiki/Screenshots Here you will find some screenshots]

Measureit has clamp support. You can see the data from every clamp and the total usage from a sensor with multiple clamps.

The storage database is optimized to store millions of voltage data without using much storage. In 4 months a sensor writes about 1.000.000 data sets that use just about 25 MB of storage. Measureit delete old data automatically after a user defined period.

The hardware used with this project comes from currentcost that offers a base station with up to 9 sensors. Measureit supports the usage up to all 9 sensors and multiple clamps per Sensor.

You can send the consumption data and the produced data from your solar system to the [http://pvoutput.org PVOutput] Service too. Every clamp, sensor or IAM can send data to their service. So you are able to see your data from everywhere without running a server at your home. They are creating nice graphs too :)

There are options to create notifications per email or twitter if a user defined usage / generation is over / under a user defined value / time. 

More informations about measureit you can find in the wiki from the project.
